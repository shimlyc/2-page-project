<p class="mt-5 para2">Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the<br> world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe,<br> a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is<br> no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which<br> all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be <br>truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

<p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good <br>and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings <br>about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

    What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set<br> foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.

<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon<br> seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's <br>how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and<br> cherish her.</p>
<p>
    For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and<br> perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes<br> your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more<br> valuable than those which divide us.

The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.<br> Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next<br> year and yet far too little for the next ten.</p>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or<br> even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying <br>out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h1 class="mt-5 fw-bold">Reaching for the Stars</h1>
<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size.<br> Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can <br>imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate,<br> that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing <br>this has to change a man.</p>
